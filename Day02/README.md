## Day 2

Not difficult problem, the most problematic for me was parsing input information. First, I made it on my own using standard functions for dealing with strings (e.g., `span`, `words`, `filter`). Since it could be problematic later for more complicated input format, I prepared another version employing parser combinator library to get some experience with parsing.

## What I have learnt:

- type definition using `type` 
- new functions (`span`)
- basic list comprehension
- parsing input text using parser combinator ReadP
