## Day 3

The tricky part of the problem was how to represent input data. Although a two-dimensional grid was used as an input, horizontal direction seemed to me as more important than vertical (since numbers were located only horizontally, not vertically). Therefore, I decided to risk and simply use two lists - a list of numbers and a list of symbols (along with their positions). Their position in the grid was given as a list of all grid positions taken by them.

This simple representation, developed for the first task, was luckily usable for the second task as well. 

## What I have learnt:
 
- type definition using `data`
- more about list comprehension
