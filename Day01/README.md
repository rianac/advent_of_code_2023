## Day 1

Basically, my first haskell program (well not exactly - the second one :-).

I tried to apply knowledge from haskell books. The first attempt was a bit clumsy, the presented code is a result after several rounds of polishing.

I spent time to create overall file structure suitable for advent of code problems (functions `task1`, `task2`, `testTask1`, `testTask2`, and `main` will be uniformly used for the next days' problems as well).

## What I have learnt:
 
- a few useful functions I did not have a clue about (e.g. `isPrefixOf`)
- basic work in monadic context
