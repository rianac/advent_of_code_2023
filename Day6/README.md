## Day 6

Input format was so simple, that I did not use parser combinators but only a one-liner function.

I decided not to use a brute force approach to find two bounds of an interval but made small analysis and designed two formulas for calculating the lower and upper limits of this interval. As a result, I struggled with numerical calculations and number conversions. Not so easy in Haskell.

## What I have learnt:

- different numerical types and related typeclasses
- conversions between numerical types (especially between integrals and floating-point numbers)
