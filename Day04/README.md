## Day 4

The first task very easy - it was enough to use a list of cards. The second one was more tricky due to increasingly additions of more and more cards. Using the previously used representation for this task would be deadly. I enriched the representation a bit to finish the task smoothly. 

## What I have learnt:
 
- creating and working with record-like structures
- record wild cards pragma
- set-like functions for lists (`intersection`)
- importance of fitting representation to task to be solved
