## Day 9

Generally, the problem looked (and was) quite easy. But not for me - I decided to try regular expressions for parsing input data, since input format was not complicated. Unfortunately, I made a bug (no parsing of minus sign for negative numbers - all numbers parsed as positive ones) which did not manifest for data in the given example dataset, but did not parse data from bigger input very well. As a result, I was hunting the bug for quite a long time, since I looked at algorithmic and not parsing code. 

## What I have learnt:

- simple cases for regex matching
- infinite sequences (`iterate`)
